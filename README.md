# Silent-Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction-System
I have developed an AI-powered system that uses machine learning and deep learning to predict the risk of silent heart attacks. The system incorporates full data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature correlation, and the implementation of multiple predictive models to enhance the assessment of cardiovascular risk.
